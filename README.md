# Combining Spatial Computing Blocks [-> `Exercises.kt`](src/main/kotlin/collektive/exercises/Exercises.kt):

#### Basic exercises:
1. Select a node identified as `source`, chosen by finding the node with minimum uid in the network. 
2. Compute the distances between any node and the `source`.
3. Calculate in the source an estimate of the true diameter of the network (the maximum distance of a device in the network).
4. Broadcast the diameter to every node in the network.

#### Advanced exercises:
5. Consider the source identified in exercise 1, determine nodes 3 hops away from the source.
6. Consider a set of sources, determine the number of hops towards the nearest source.
7. Determine the the max number of hops towards the nearest source identified in exercise 6.
